TLS (Transport Layer Security) protects confidentiality, integrity, and — when properly used — authenticity for traffic between clients and servers. Behind the simple &amp;ldquo;https&amp;rdquo; URL there are layers of protocol design, public-key cryptography, symmetric ciphers, certificate chains and revocation systems, ephemeral key exchanges, and subtle deployment pitfalls. This post explores TLS in depth: the record protocol, handshakes (with a focus on TLS 1.3), certificate validation and PKI, cipher suites and AEAD, performance considerations, QUIC integration, operational security, and testing and hardening advice.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Software Supply Chain Security: SBOMs, Sigstore, Reproducible Builds, and Attestation</title><link>https://lbenicio.dev/blog/software-supply-chain-security-sboms-sigstore-reproducible-builds-and-attestation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lbenicio.dev/blog/software-supply-chain-security-sboms-sigstore-reproducible-builds-and-attestation/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The software supply chain is the set of processes, tools, and artifacts that transform source code into software that runs in production. Protecting that supply chain is critical: compromises at any step — compromised dependencies, corrupted CI/CD pipelines, or forged releases — can lead to large-scale incidents that affect thousands of downstream systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post explains the modern toolbox for defending the software supply chain: Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) formats and generation, provenance and attestation concepts, Sigstore for transparent signature &amp;amp; provenance, reproducible builds, SLSA (Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts), secure signing and key management, package ecosystem-specific hazards (npm, PyPI, crates.io), and operational practices for CI/CD and incident response.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
