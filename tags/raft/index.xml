When a single process is replaced by a collection of cooperating processes that communicate over unreliable networks, familiar assumptions break: partial failure becomes the norm, time is not globally synchronized, and correctness requires making explicit trade-offs. This post covers the foundations you need to reason about building correct, robust, and performant distributed systems: failure models, consensus and leader election, replication and consistency models, gossip and membership, CRDTs for conflict-free replication, testing strategies (including Jepsen-style fault injection), and operational best practices.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Raft Fast‑Commit and PreVote in Practice</title><link>https://lbenicio.dev/blog/raft-fastcommit-and-prevote-in-practice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2020 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lbenicio.dev/blog/raft-fastcommit-and-prevote-in-practice/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Raft’s original paper optimizes for understandability. Production clusters optimize for availability and mean‑time‑to‑recovery. Two common extensions—PreVote and fast‑commit—reduce needless disruptions and trim the time it takes to make progress. Let’s unpack them without hand‑waving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-pain-disruptive-elections-and-long-commit-paths"&gt;The pain: disruptive elections and long commit paths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without PreVote, a partitioned follower may increment term and trigger elections on rejoin, ousting a healthy leader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without fast‑commit, clients wait for the full round‑trip alignment even when a quorum already holds the entry durably.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="prevote"&gt;PreVote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PreVote adds a “dry‑run” phase: before incrementing term, a candidate asks peers if they’d vote. Peers reject if their logs are more up‑to‑date.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
