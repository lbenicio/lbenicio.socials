When a single process is replaced by a collection of cooperating processes that communicate over unreliable networks, familiar assumptions break: partial failure becomes the norm, time is not globally synchronized, and correctness requires making explicit trade-offs. This post covers the foundations you need to reason about building correct, robust, and performant distributed systems: failure models, consensus and leader election, replication and consistency models, gossip and membership, CRDTs for conflict-free replication, testing strategies (including Jepsen-style fault injection), and operational best practices.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Designing CRDT-Powered Collaboration Platforms that Stay Consistent</title><link>https://lbenicio.dev/blog/designing-crdt-powered-collaboration-platforms-that-stay-consistent/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lbenicio.dev/blog/designing-crdt-powered-collaboration-platforms-that-stay-consistent/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Real-time collaboration has shifted from a feature to a baseline expectation. Teams sketch ideas in shared whiteboards, edit code together, and annotate product specs while sitting on unreliable networks. Delivering that experience demands more than WebSockets and optimistic UI code. The hard part is consistency: making sure each participant converges on the same state despite offline edits, concurrent operations, and shaky connectivity. Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) emerged as the workhorse that keeps these experiences coherent.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
