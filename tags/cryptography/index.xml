TLS (Transport Layer Security) protects confidentiality, integrity, and — when properly used — authenticity for traffic between clients and servers. Behind the simple &amp;ldquo;https&amp;rdquo; URL there are layers of protocol design, public-key cryptography, symmetric ciphers, certificate chains and revocation systems, ephemeral key exchanges, and subtle deployment pitfalls. This post explores TLS in depth: the record protocol, handshakes (with a focus on TLS 1.3), certificate validation and PKI, cipher suites and AEAD, performance considerations, QUIC integration, operational security, and testing and hardening advice.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Countdown to Quantum: Migrating an Enterprise to Post-Quantum Cryptography</title><link>https://lbenicio.dev/blog/countdown-to-quantum-migrating-an-enterprise-to-post-quantum-cryptography/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2024 16:40:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lbenicio.dev/blog/countdown-to-quantum-migrating-an-enterprise-to-post-quantum-cryptography/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When the first credible quantum threat report reached our CISO&amp;rsquo;s desk, the reaction was cautious curiosity. Quantum computers capable of breaking RSA-2048 remain years away, but data harvested today could be decrypted decades later. We handle sensitive customer contracts, healthcare records, and government workloads. Waiting for the quantum threat to manifest felt irresponsible. So we embarked on a multi-year migration to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). This post documents the journey—strategy, tooling, experiments, and the human moments that kept the program afloat.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Security Engineering (3rd ed.)</title><link>https://lbenicio.dev/reading/security-engineering-3rd-ed./</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lbenicio.dev/reading/security-engineering-3rd-ed./</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;An encyclopedic treatment of security engineering principles, attacks, and defenses.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
