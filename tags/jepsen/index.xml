When a single process is replaced by a collection of cooperating processes that communicate over unreliable networks, familiar assumptions break: partial failure becomes the norm, time is not globally synchronized, and correctness requires making explicit trade-offs. This post covers the foundations you need to reason about building correct, robust, and performant distributed systems: failure models, consensus and leader election, replication and consistency models, gossip and membership, CRDTs for conflict-free replication, testing strategies (including Jepsen-style fault injection), and operational best practices.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
