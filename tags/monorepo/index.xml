They also create CI/CD nightmares if builds become flaky, nondeterministic, or painfully slow. Deterministic CI platforms tame that chaos by ensuring every pipeline run produces the same outputs given the same inputs—no matter which engineer kicks it off, which runner executes it, or when it happens. This article is a long-form walkthrough for platform teams charged with shipping deterministic CI in sprawling monorepos covering mobile apps, microservices, infrastructure code, and ML assets. Expect hard-earned lessons, architectural blueprints, and operational playbooks drawn from companies that run tens of thousands of jobs per day without losing their sanity.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
