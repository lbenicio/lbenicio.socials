This illusion of parallelism requires the operating system to rapidly switch between processes, giving each a slice of CPU time. The scheduler—the component that decides who runs next—profoundly affects system responsiveness, throughput, and fairness. Understanding scheduling reveals why your interactive applications feel smooth or sluggish and why some workloads perform better than others.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>System Calls: The Gateway Between User Space and Kernel</title><link>https://lbenicio.dev/blog/system-calls-the-gateway-between-user-space-and-kernel/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lbenicio.dev/blog/system-calls-the-gateway-between-user-space-and-kernel/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Every time your program opens a file, allocates memory, or sends a network packet, it crosses an invisible boundary. User programs cannot directly access hardware or kernel data structures—they must ask the operating system to do it for them through system calls. Understanding this interface is fundamental to systems programming and helps explain performance characteristics, security boundaries, and the design of operating systems themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

The simple act of opening a connection hides layers of protocol machinery handling packet routing, reliable delivery, congestion control, and flow management. Understanding how sockets work and how data traverses the TCP/IP stack illuminates why networks behave as they do and how to build efficient networked applications.&lt;/p&gt;
